# Migration Locking

DBWarden uses a database-level lock to prevent concurrent schema mutation. This page explains how it works, what happens when it fails, and how to recover from a stuck lock.

## How locking works

When `dbwarden migrate` runs, it:

1. Acquires a lock row in the `dbwarden_lock` table (created on first use; the table name is `dbwarden_lock`, not `_dbwarden_lock`)
2. Executes all pending migrations within that lock
3. Releases the lock on success or failure

The lock is stored in the target database itself: no external service (Redis, filesystem) is required.

If a second `migrate` invocation starts while the first holds the lock, it fails immediately with:

```
LockError: Migration lock is already held. Another migration process may be running.
Use 'dbwarden unlock' to release the lock if necessary.
```

DBWarden does not retry on lock failure. The calling process (CI job, deploy script) must decide whether to retry or abort.

## Inspecting lock state

```bash
$ dbwarden lock-status --database primary
```

Output when unlocked:

```
Migration lock: INACTIVE
```

Output when locked:

```
Migration lock: ACTIVE
Another migration process may be running.
```

Use the `locked_at` timestamp in the lock table to determine whether the lock is held by a live process or is stale.

## When a migration fails mid-run

If a migration raises an error after partial execution:

1. DBWarden rolls back the in-flight transaction (if the database supports transactional DDL, PostgreSQL does, MySQL does not)
2. The lock is released
3. The CLI exits non-zero

For PostgreSQL, partial application within a migration file is rolled back atomically. The migration remains in "pending" state.

For MySQL and databases without transactional DDL, partial application is possible. Inspect the database state manually before retrying.

## Stuck lock recovery

A lock becomes stale when:

- The migration process was killed (SIGKILL, OOM, machine restart)
- A CI job was cancelled mid-run
- A deploy container was stopped before migrate completed

**Before unlocking, confirm no migration is running:**

```bash
# Check if the PID from lock-status is still alive
ps aux | grep <pid>

# Or check your deployment logs / CI job status
```

If the process is genuinely dead:

```bash
# 1. Confirm lock state
$ dbwarden lock-status --database primary

# 2. Inspect migration history to see what ran last
$ dbwarden history --database primary

# 3. Check pending migrations
$ dbwarden status --database primary

# 4. Release the stale lock
$ dbwarden unlock --database primary

# 5. Retry migration
$ dbwarden migrate --database primary
```

## When NOT to use `unlock`

Do not run `unlock` if:

- You are unsure whether a migration process is still running
- The `locked_at` timestamp is recent (within seconds or minutes); the process may still be alive
- Multiple processes share a database and you cannot confirm all are idle

Releasing a lock held by a live migration process will allow a second migration to start concurrently, which can corrupt schema state.

## Preventing concurrent migration in CI

In CI/CD, run migrations from a single job with no parallelism:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions: serialize via job dependency
jobs:
  migrate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: dbwarden migrate --database primary
  deploy:
    needs: migrate
    ...
```

If your pipeline can trigger multiple concurrent deploys, add a concurrency group:

```yaml
concurrency:
  group: migrate-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: false
```

`cancel-in-progress: false` queues the second run instead of cancelling it, which avoids orphaned locks from killed jobs.

### 6. Confirm status

Run `dbwarden status` to verify no pending migrations remain:

```bash
$ dbwarden status --database primary
```

## Distributed locking with Redis

For multi-instance deployments where multiple application replicas could
trigger migrations concurrently, DBWarden provides a Redis-backed
distributed lock through `dbwarden.fastapi.lock`:

```python
from dbwarden.fastapi import migration_lock

# Within a FastAPI route or lifespan:
async with migration_lock() as locked:
    if locked:
        await run_migration()
```

The Redis lock uses `SETNX` + `EXPIRE` with a default TTL of 60 seconds.
If the application crashes while holding the lock, Redis releases it
automatically after the TTL expires. Long-running migrations should
specify a custom TTL or implement lock extension.

The lock is also used internally by the `POST /migrate` FastAPI endpoint
to serialize migration requests across application instances.

### Database-level vs Redis lock

| Aspect | Database lock | Redis lock |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Scope | CLI commands (`migrate`, `seed`) | FastAPI `POST /migrate` endpoint |
| Storage | `dbwarden_lock` table in the target database | Redis key |
| TTL | No TTL: manual `unlock` required after crash | 60-second default TTL |
| Failure mode | Blocks other CLI commands until released | Auto-released after TTL |
| External dependency | None (uses the database itself) | Redis required |

Both locks can be used independently or together; they guard different
entry points. The database lock protects the CLI; the Redis lock
protects the FastAPI endpoint.

## Lifespan integration

The `dbwarden_lifespan` context manager wraps migration logic and
engine disposal into a single FastAPI-compatible lifespan. When using
the Redis lock in a lifespan, acquire the lock before entering the
migration context:

```python
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from fastapi import FastAPI
from dbwarden.fastapi import dbwarden_lifespan, migration_lock

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    async with migration_lock():
        async with dbwarden_lifespan(mode="migrate", allow_in_production=True):
            yield
```
