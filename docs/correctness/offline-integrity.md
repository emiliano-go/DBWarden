# Offline Integrity

Offline integrity lets DBWarden generate migrations without connecting to a live database. It does this by comparing current models to a checked-in model state file or schema snapshot instead of querying the database at generation time.

This is a correctness feature because it removes accidental dependence on a developer's local database. CI can generate or verify migrations from repository state alone.

## Snapshot and Model State Concepts

DBWarden uses two related state files.

### Schema Snapshots

After migrations are applied, DBWarden can write checksummed schema snapshots under `.dbwarden/schemas/`. These snapshots represent the database schema after a migration point.

They support:

- Rename detection
- Offline comparisons
- Column-level diffing without querying a live database
- Auditability of schema history

### Model State

`export-models` writes a model state JSON file, usually under `.dbwarden/model_state.json` or a database-specific variant. This file records the model-derived schema state that offline migration generation uses as a baseline.

Create it with:

```bash
dbwarden export-models --database primary
```

Commit it with the repository:

```bash
git add .dbwarden/model_state.json
git commit -m "Update DBWarden model state"
```

The model state file is important. It is the offline source of truth for the last accepted schema state.

## Offline Migration Generation

Offline migration generation compares the checked-in state file with the current models:

```text
Checked-in model state
  |
  v
Normalize baseline

Current SQLAlchemy models
  |
  v
Extract model state

Baseline + current model state
  |
  v
Offline diff
  |
  v
Generated migration SQL and plan
```

Run it with:

```bash
dbwarden make-migrations "add profile fields" --offline --database primary
```

If the state file is missing, DBWarden tells you to run `export-models` first. If the state file is invalid, DBWarden refuses to use it.

## Integrity Check

Model state and schema snapshots are checksummed. Before DBWarden uses a state file, it validates that the file content matches the stored checksum.

The reason is straightforward:

```text
State file on disk
  |
  v
Recompute SHA-256 checksum
  |
  v
Compare with stored checksum
  |
  +--> match: use the state file
  |
  +--> mismatch: refuse and ask for regeneration
```

This protects against accidental edits, merge corruption, and stale generated files. A modified JSON file should not silently become the baseline for migration generation.

## CI Workflow Example

A deterministic CI workflow can use offline generation first, then live convergence when a database service is available.

```yaml
name: dbwarden-offline-integrity

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  offline-integrity:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      - name: Install project
        run: pip install -e .

      - name: Generate migrations from checked-in state
        run: dbwarden make-migrations "ci offline check" --offline --database primary

      - name: Show changed files
        run: git status --short
```

In a strict repository, CI should fail if offline generation creates unexpected changes. That means a developer changed models without committing the corresponding migration or model state update.

The live convergence job can run after this step:

```text
Offline integrity
  |
  v
Generated files are stable
  |
  v
Live convergence gate
  |
  v
Generated SQL applies and matches models
```

See [Convergence Gate](convergence-gate.md).

## Example Failure

Assume the committed model state says `users` has two columns:

```json
{
  "tables": {
    "users": {
      "columns": {
        "id": {"type": "INTEGER", "primary_key": true},
        "email": {"type": "VARCHAR(255)", "nullable": false}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A developer adds a model field:

```python
display_name: Mapped[str | None] = mapped_column(String(255), nullable=True)
```

Then CI runs:

```bash
dbwarden make-migrations "ci offline check" --offline --database primary
```

DBWarden detects the difference between the committed state and current models:

```sql
-- upgrade
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN display_name VARCHAR(255);

-- rollback
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN display_name;
```

If this migration was expected, commit it. If it was not expected, the model change is accidental and should be reverted or corrected.

## Why Offline Integrity Improves Correctness

Offline integrity decouples migration generation from live database accidents.

Without offline state, a developer's local database could contain manual changes. DBWarden might diff against that local drift and produce a migration that looks correct on one machine but fails in CI or production.

With offline state:

- The baseline is versioned in git.
- The same inputs produce the same diff.
- CI can detect missing migrations without a database service.
- Tampered state files are rejected by checksum validation.

Offline integrity is not the final proof. The final proof is still a live database convergence gate. Offline integrity ensures the inputs to that gate are deterministic.
