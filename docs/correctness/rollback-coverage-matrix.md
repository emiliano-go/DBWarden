# Rollback Coverage Matrix

This matrix describes rollback behavior implemented by the PostgreSQL and ClickHouse handlers. It distinguishes real inverse SQL from conditional rollback, explicit irreversible changes, and placeholder or manual rollback comments.

## Classification

- `real`: Emits executable reverse SQL for the normal operation.
- `conditional`: Emits executable reverse SQL only when dbwarden can prove the operation is structurally reversible from static metadata and all required prior state is present. Conditional must be explicit and limited. If rollback safety is not secured, the operation must not be classified as conditional.
- `irreversible`: The operation is intentionally marked or treated as not safely reversible.
- `placeholder`: Rollback is a comment, manual instruction, or incomplete placeholder.
- `no-op`: No reverse action is expected for the operation.

## Warning Policy

- `irreversible` rollback emits a warning during standard migration generation.
- `conditional` rollback emits a warning only in verbose mode.
- `placeholder` rollback is a hard generation error by default.
- Placeholder rollback comments are allowed only for explicitly irreversible or manual cases, not as a successful rollback claim.
- The committed-migration escape hatch is an explicit annotation: `-- dbwarden: irreversible`.
- `--allow-placeholder-rollback` is intentionally not the primary escape hatch and should be treated only as a future local-development convenience.

## ClickHouse Recreate Policy

ClickHouse table recreation uses a detect-and-refuse rollback policy. Unknown means unsafe.

| Case | Classification | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structurally lossy transitions | irreversible | Engines such as `ReplacingMergeTree`, `SummingMergeTree`, `AggregatingMergeTree`, `CollapsingMergeTree`, and `VersionedCollapsingMergeTree` may collapse, deduplicate, aggregate, or otherwise lose row-level detail. Reverse recreate cannot restore data that no longer exists. |
| Structurally reversible transitions | conditional | Both engine families must be known row-preserving, such as `MergeTree`, `ReplicatedMergeTree`, `Memory`, `Log`, `TinyLog`, and `StripeLog`. Rollback emits reverse recreate SQL, and should be promoted only when covered by live round-trip tests. |
| Cannot-tell transitions | irreversible | Custom engines, unknown engines, unparsed engine behavior, or transitions whose safety depends on data are treated as irreversible. |

## PostgreSQL

| `drop_schema` | real | Rollback recreates the schema. |

## ClickHouse

| Operation | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `alter_ch_options` | conditional | TTL/settings/order-by can emit inverse ALTERs; immutable/recreate-required keys can require manual handling. |

| `alter_ch_dict` | conditional | Create/drop reversible when options exist; unsupported alter keys emit manual comments. |
| `create_ch_named_collection` | real | Rollback drops collection. |
| `drop_ch_named_collection` | conditional | Recreates the named collection from prior entries and overridable flags captured in `rollback_attrs`. |

| `ChRbacHandler` | no-op | No op types are emitted by this wrapper. |

## Manual and Irreversible Boundaries

These cases are not open rollback gaps. They are explicit policy boundaries where DBWarden either emits no rollback because no schema state changes, requires authored SQL, or marks the operation irreversible.

| Case | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| PostgreSQL partition strategy changes | Require a table rebuild or hand-authored migration. DBWarden refuses automatic rollback because changing partition strategy is not a metadata-only inverse. |
| PostgreSQL `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` | Rollback is intentionally no-op because refresh does not change schema definition. |
| PostgreSQL enum value additions | Irreversible in PostgreSQL because enum values cannot be removed directly. |
| ClickHouse data operations | Require authored rollback SQL when a reverse data operation exists; otherwise they remain explicitly irreversible. |
| ClickHouse engine transitions | Conditional reverse recreate is allowed only for known row-preserving engine families. Lossy and unknown transitions are irreversible by policy. |

For ordinary generated drop and alter operations, prior state is captured at generation time from the live schema snapshot or from the baseline snapshot used by offline and squash workflows. The captured definition is serialized through `rollback_attrs`, preserved in the migration plan, and consumed by the backend handler that emits rollback SQL. If the required prior state is missing, strict generation fails instead of accepting placeholder rollback.
