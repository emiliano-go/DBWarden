# Materialized views

## Plain MVs: two shapes

### Mode A: Class IS the target table (preferred)

The view class IS the target table; `__tablename__` is the table name.
The MV is auto-generated as `f"{__tablename__}_mv"`.  Columns, engine, and
`order_by` are required.

Columns are declared via `mapped_column` on the class.  Although no
SQLAlchemy `Base` is needed; the class is NOT a SQLAlchemy model, and
`session.query(ClassName)` will *not* work; the column descriptors are
read from `cls.__dict__` by the discovery pipeline.

```python
from sqlalchemy import func
from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column
from dbwarden.databases.clickhouse import MaterializedView, CHViewMeta, materialized_view, merge_tree

class EventCount(MaterializedView):
    __tablename__ = "event_counts"

    date: Mapped[date] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    count: Mapped[int] = mapped_column()

    class Meta(CHViewMeta):
        ch = materialized_view(
            select=func.sum(Event.amount).label("total"),
            engine=merge_tree(),
            order_by=["date"],
        )
```

Generated DDL:

```sql
CREATE TABLE event_counts (date Date, count Int64)
ENGINE = MergeTree() ORDER BY date

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW event_counts_mv TO event_counts
AS SELECT sum(amount) AS total FROM events
```

### Mode B: Explicit `to=` target

The class IS the MV; it writes to a pre-existing target table.  No columns,
no engine, no `order_by`; the target owns its own storage.

```python
from sqlalchemy import func
from dbwarden.databases.clickhouse import MaterializedView, CHViewMeta, materialized_view

class EventCountMV(MaterializedView):
    __tablename__ = "event_counts_mv"

    class Meta(CHViewMeta):
        ch = materialized_view(
            select=func.sum(Event.amount).label("total"),
            to="events_dest",
        )
```

Generated DDL:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW event_counts_mv TO events_dest
AS SELECT sum(amount) AS total FROM events
```

## Refreshable MVs (24.3+)

```python
class DailyRollupMV(MaterializedView):
    __tablename__ = "daily_rollup_mv"

    class Meta(CHViewMeta):
        ch = materialized_view(
            select=func.sum(Event.amount).label("total"),
            to="rollup_dest",
            refresh="EVERY 3600 SECONDS",
        )
```

Generated DDL:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW daily_rollup_mv TO rollup_dest
REFRESH EVERY 3600 SECONDS
AS SELECT sum(amount) AS total FROM events
```

Refreshable MVs (introduced in CH 24.3) replace LIVE VIEW and support:
- Periodic refresh (`EVERY n SECONDS`)
- Refresh dependencies (`DEPENDS ON`)
- Refresh on cluster (`ON CLUSTER`)
- Empty vs populating initial state

## Additional model examples

### Refreshable MV with DEPENDS ON

```python
class HourlyRollupMV(MaterializedView):
    __tablename__ = "hourly_rollup_mv"

    class Meta(CHViewMeta):
        ch = materialized_view(
            select=func.sum(Event.amount).label("total"),
            to="hourly_rollup_dest",
            refresh="EVERY 300 SECONDS",
        )
```

Generated DDL:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_rollup_mv TO hourly_rollup_dest
REFRESH EVERY 300 SECONDS
AS SELECT sum(amount) AS total FROM events
```

### MV on clustered setup

```python
class ClusterMV(MaterializedView):
    __tablename__ = "cluster_mv"

    class Meta(CHViewMeta):
        ch = materialized_view(
            select="SELECT hostName() AS node, count(*) AS cnt FROM events",
            to="cluster_mv_dest",
        )
```

### MV chaining (MV reading from MV)

```python
# First MV: raw -> hourly
class RawToHourlyMV(MaterializedView):
    __tablename__ = "raw_to_hourly_mv"
    class Meta(CHViewMeta):
        ch = materialized_view(
            select=func.sum(Raw.value).label("total"),
            to="hourly_dest",
        )

# Second MV: hourly -> daily
class HourlyToDailyMV(MaterializedView):
    __tablename__ = "hourly_to_daily_mv"
    class Meta(CHViewMeta):
        ch = materialized_view(
            select=func.sum(HourlyDest.total).label("total"),
            to="daily_dest",
        )
```

## What the `.inner` table is

When an MV has no `TO target` (deprecated module-level form only), ClickHouse
creates a hidden table named ``.inner.<view_name>`` with the MV's result
schema.  dbwarden reverse-engineers this table during ``generate-models``.

The class API **does not support** implicit ``.inner.`` storage; every
MV must either be the target (Mode A) or name a target (Mode B).  The
``.inner.`` form appears only when reverse-engineering legacy MVs that were
created outside dbwarden.

## `MODIFY QUERY` vs recreate

ClickHouse supports `ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY QUERY` for refreshable MVs. For
plain (non-refreshable) MVs, the query is immutable: any change requires a
DROP + CREATE.

dbwarden classifies this as:

| MV type | `MODIFY QUERY` | Safety |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Refreshable | Supported | INFO |
| Plain (non-refreshable) | Not supported by CH | CRITICAL: requires `--force` |

## `POPULATE` as data operation

`POPULATE` is a one-time statement that inserts existing source data into the
MV on creation. dbwarden treats it as a
[data operation](data-operations.md), not a DDL property:

```python
from dbwarden.databases.clickhouse import data_ops
from dbwarden.databases.clickhouse.materialized_view import materialized_view

spec = materialized_view(
    name="event_counts_mv",
    select="SELECT sum(amount) AS total FROM events",
    to="events_dest",
)
pop = data_ops.populate(spec)
```

This is because `POPULATE` is a write concern, not a structural declaration:
it runs once during creation and changes nothing about the schema.

## What changes are allowed

| Change | Safety |
|--------|--------|
| Add/drop MV | WARN |
| Change `TO` target | CRITICAL: requires recreate |
| Change SELECT (non-refreshable) | CRITICAL: requires recreate |
| Change SELECT (refreshable) | INFO |
| Change refresh interval | INFO |
| Toggle POPULATE | Data-op, not structural |

## Rollback behavior

MV DROP is a rollback of MV CREATE. Data created by the MV is not restored by
rollback of the DDL: you must re-POPULATE.
