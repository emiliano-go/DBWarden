# Named collections

Named collections are the mechanism for declaring credentials without exposing secret values. They are declared in the config layer, referenced by name from engine and RBAC specs.

## Declaration

```python
from dbwarden import database_config
from dbwarden.databases.clickhouse import named_collection

database_config(
    name="analytics",
    url="clickhouse://...",
    ch_named_collections=[
        named_collection(
            name="kafka_prod",
            keys={
                "sasl_username": "kafka_user",
# sasl_password is NOT declared here: it comes from the
        # secret store. See "declare-only" below.
            },
        ),
        named_collection(
            name="s3_prod",
            keys={
                "region": "us-east-1",
                "access_key_id": "AKIA...",
            },
        ),
    ],
)
```

## Key-set diffed, values declare-only

Named collections are diffed on their **key set**: what keys are declared and what values are referenced. The **values themselves are never diffed**. This is the "declare-only" principle:

- `named_collection("kafka_prod", keys={"sasl_username": "kafka_user"})` declares that a collection named `kafka_prod` should have the key `sasl_username`.
- The value `"kafka_user"` is metadata for dbwarden's diff output but is **never compared** to the server state. Secret values (`password`, `sasl_password`, `secret_access_key`) are not declared at all: they come from ClickHouse's secret store.

This means dbwarden will detect that a key exists in a model but is missing from the server, and emit `CREATE NAMED COLLECTION ...`. But it will never emit `ALTER NAMED COLLECTION` with a changed password value: it can't know the real value.

## Additional model examples

### Named collection for Postgres engine

```python
named_collection(
    name="pg_source",
    keys={
        "connection_string": "postgresql://user:pass@pg-host:5432/db",
        "port": "5432",
    },
)
```

### Named collection with cluster and secret reference

```python
named_collection(
    name="kafka_secure",
    keys={
        "bootstrap_servers": "kafka-broker:9092",
        "sasl_mechanism": "SCRAM-SHA-256",
        "sasl_username": "ch_user",
        # sasl_password = SECRET(...) stored in ClickHouse secret store
        "security_protocol": "sasl_ssl",
    },
)
```

Engine usage:

```python
engine = kafka_engine(
    named_collection="kafka_secure",
    topic="events",
    format="Avro",
    group_name="dbwarden",
)
```

### Dict config (raw path)

```python
database_config(
    name="analytics",
    url="clickhouse://localhost:9000",
    ch_named_collections=[
        {
            "name": "s3_data",
            "keys": {
                "region": "us-east-1",
                "url": "https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket",
            },
        },
    ],
)
```

## Reference from engines

```python
engine = kafka_engine(
    named_collection="kafka_prod",
    topic="events",
)
```

The engine gets credentials from the named collection. The named collection is referenced by name only in the engine settings (`kafka_named_collection`, `s3_named_collection`, etc.).

## Reference from RBAC

```python
ch_user_spec(
    named_collection="ldap_prod",
    ...
)
```

## What changes are allowed

| Change | Safety |
|--------|--------|
| Add named collection | INFO |
| Drop named collection | WARN (may break references) |
| Add key to declaration | INFO |
| Remove key from declaration | WARN |
| Change a non-secret value | INFO |
| Secret values | Not tracked |

## Rollback behavior

`DROP NAMED COLLECTION` rolls back as `CREATE NAMED COLLECTION`. Key changes roll back as inverse key changes.
