# Object Plugins

An object plugin adds a database object **type** to DBWarden's schema convergence pipeline. Core drives your handler through the same extract → canonicalize → diff → emit flow it uses for tables, so the object is diffed against the live database and emitted in the right SQL order.

## Scope Test

An object plugin is the right tool when the feature is **database state declared by the model (or config) and converged by DBWarden**, not a one-off script. Good candidates: extensions, roles, grants, policies, triggers, functions, sequences, and backend-specific declarative objects. If the thing you want isn't schema state DBWarden should diff and emit, use a value hook or a migration instead.

## The `ObjectHandler` Contract

A handler is any object exposing these attributes and methods (see `dbwarden.engine.core.protocol.ObjectHandler`):

```python
object_type: str                 # unique registration key, e.g. "pg_extension"
op_types: tuple[str, ...]        # op names this handler emits, e.g. ("create_pg_extension", ...)
run_phase: RunPhase              # PREAMBLE or DIFF
ordering: OrderingConstraint     # public anchors (optional)

def extract(self, snapshot) -> dict: ...           # DB snapshot -> current spec
def model_spec_from_config(self, config) -> dict: ...  # config -> desired spec
def model_spec_from_tables(self, model_tables) -> dict: ...  # models -> desired spec
def canonicalize(self, spec) -> dict: ...          # normalize for comparison
def diff(self, snap_spec, model_spec) -> tuple[list[Op], list[Op]]: ...  # (upgrade, rollback)
def emit(self, op, db_name=None, **kwargs) -> list[MigrationStatement]: ...  # Op -> SQL
```

## Step By Step: A `CREATE EXTENSION` Handler

The goal: converge the PostgreSQL extensions declared in config (`config.pg_extensions`) with those present in the database. This mirrors the real [`dbwarden-pgsql-extensions`](https://github.com/dbwarden-org/dbwarden-pgsql-extensions) `PgExtensionHandler`.

### 1. Import the public types

```python
from dbwarden.engine.core import (
    Anchor,
    MigrationStatement,
    Op,
    OrderingConstraint,
    RunPhase,
)
```

### 2. Declare identity, phase, and ordering

Extensions must exist before anything that uses them, so pin the handler between `PREAMBLE` and `BEFORE_TABLES`:

```python
class PgExtensionHandler:
    object_type = "pg_extension"
    op_types = ("create_pg_extension", "drop_pg_extension")
    run_phase = RunPhase.PREAMBLE
    ordering = OrderingConstraint(
        after=(Anchor.PREAMBLE,),
        before=(Anchor.BEFORE_TABLES,),
    )
```

### 3. Read current state from the snapshot

```python
    def extract(self, snapshot):
        return snapshot.get("pg_extensions", {})
```

### 4. Read desired state

```python
    def model_spec_from_config(self, config):
        return {name: {} for name in getattr(config, "pg_extensions", [])}

    def model_spec_from_tables(self, model_tables):
        return {}  # extensions come from config, not model tables
```

### 5. Canonicalize and diff

`canonicalize` normalizes both sides so comparison is apples-to-apples (the real handler lowercases names and sorts). `diff` returns `(upgrade_ops, rollback_ops)`, emitting a create for what's missing and a drop for what's extra, with the inverse recorded for rollback:

```python
    def canonicalize(self, spec):
        return {str(n).lower(): dict(v or {}) for n, v in sorted((spec or {}).items())}

    def diff(self, snap_spec, model_spec):
        upgrade_ops, rollback_ops = [], []
        snap, model = snap_spec or {}, model_spec or {}
        for name in sorted(set(model) - set(snap)):        # missing -> create
            attrs = {"name": name}
            upgrade_ops.append(Op("create_pg_extension", attrs, attrs))
            rollback_ops.insert(0, Op("drop_pg_extension", attrs, attrs))
        for name in sorted(set(snap) - set(model)):        # extra -> drop
            attrs = {"name": name}
            upgrade_ops.append(Op("drop_pg_extension", attrs, attrs))
            rollback_ops.insert(0, Op("create_pg_extension", attrs, attrs))
        return upgrade_ops, rollback_ops
```

### 6. Emit SQL

`emit` turns each `Op` into ordered SQL, branching on `op.object_type`. Use `self.statement_order`, which DBWarden sets from your `ordering` anchors (see below):

```python
    def emit(self, op, db_name=None, **kwargs):
        name = '"' + str(op.upgrade_attrs["name"]).replace('"', '""') + '"'
        if op.object_type == "create_pg_extension":
            return [MigrationStatement(
                order=self.statement_order,
                upgrade_sql=f"CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS {name};",
                rollback_sql=f"DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS {name};",
            )]
        if op.object_type == "drop_pg_extension":
            return [MigrationStatement(
                order=self.statement_order,
                upgrade_sql=f"DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS {name};",
                rollback_sql=f"CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS {name};",
            )]
        return []
```

### 7. Register it

`setup` lives in the package `__init__.py` and imports the handler module lazily:

```python
# src/dbwarden_example/__init__.py
def setup(registrar) -> None:
    from dbwarden_example.handler import PgExtensionHandler

    registrar.register_object_handler(PgExtensionHandler())
```

## Ordering And The DAG

DBWarden orders all object handlers into a single directed acyclic graph, then emits their statements in that order.

- **Anchors** place a handler relative to core milestones. At registration, DBWarden validates your `OrderingConstraint` and derives a private `statement_order` from the anchors: you never touch the integers.
- **Object-to-object** constraints (`after_object`, `before_object`) place your handler relative to *other* handlers by `object_type`:

```python
ordering = OrderingConstraint(after_object=("role",))  # emit after the "role" handler
```

Anchors are the **public contract**: `PREAMBLE`, `BEFORE_TABLES`, `AFTER_TABLES`, `AFTER_CONSTRAINTS`, `AFTER_INDEXES`, `POSTAMBLE`. See [ordering anchors](../reference/ordering-anchors.md) for the full map and failure modes (unknown references, cycles, impossible pairs).

## Conflicts And Overrides

`object_type` is the registration key. Two *different* plugins registering the same `object_type` raises `ObjectHandlerConflictError`. A plugin handler and a core handler with the same type is allowed: the plugin handler overrides core, which is how official plugins replace built-in fallbacks (e.g. the core `CREATE EXTENSION` preamble).

## Tests

Object plugins run the value-plugin conformance checks plus two handler-specific ones from the shared harness (`dbwarden.plugin_conformance`); see the [Approved standard](approved-standard.md).

- `test_object_handler_conformance`: `assert_object_handler_conformance(handler, config=...)` exercises `extract`, `canonicalize`, `diff`, and `emit` against a minimal fixture and validates the returned types and SQL shape.
- `test_ordering_constraint_satisfiable`: `assert_ordering_constraint_satisfiable(handler)` confirms the constraint is not statically impossible (no impossible anchor pair; no unknown/cyclic object references).
